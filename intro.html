{!modules: Generic Generic_util Generic_core Generic_view Generic_fun}

The library is organised in four namespaces: [Util], [Core],
[View] and [Fun].

The main namespace [Generic] contains the namespaces [Util], [View] and [Fun]
and re-exports the modules of the namespace {!Generic_core}.

The [Util] namespace contains some definitions that where
needed by the [Core] namespace but were too general to belong
there.

The [Core] namespace contains all of the definitions required
for generic programming: type expression are reflected in
the [Core.Ty.t] type, we call such values type witnesses.
The structure of types is captured by the datatype
[Core.Desc.t]. The type-indexed function [Core.Desc_fun.view]
computes the structure associated with each type. It is the
most low-level view of OCaml types. Higher-level views are
derived from this one.
[Core.Extensible] and [Core.Consumer] implement a mechanism
for creating and extending type indexed functions. This
enables us to define ad-hoc polymorphic functions.

The [View] namespace defines high-level generic views on
types. A view is a uniform representation of the structure of
types on which generic functions can be defined.

The [Fun] namespace contains generic functions. They are
defined by induction on the structure of types given by a
generic view.

Finally, the library comes with two PPX syntax extensions:

<ul>
<li> [reify] which derives the boilerplate that is
necessary to add generic support for a user type.
</li>
<li> [import] which provides a mechanism for importing a set of
names from a module.
</li>
</ul>
