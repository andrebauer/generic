{!modules: Generic_util Generic_core Generic_view Generic_fun}

The library is orgranised in four namespaces: [Util], [Core],
[View] and [Fun].

The [Util] namespace will be hidden in the future, it
contains some definitions that where needed by the [Core]
namespace but were too general to belong there.

The [Core] namespace contains all of the definitions required
for generic programming: types expression are reflected in
the [Core.Ty.t] type. The structure of types is captured by the
datatype [Core.Desc.t]. The type-indexed function
[Core.Desc_fun.view] computes the structure associated with
each type. It is the most low-level view of OCaml
types. Higher-level views are derived from this one.

The [View] namespace defines high-level generic views on
types. A view is a uniform representation of the structure of
types on which generic functions can be defined.

The [Fun] namespace contains generic functions. They are
defined by induction on the structure of types given by a
generic view.
